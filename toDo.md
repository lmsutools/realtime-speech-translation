at the bottom-bar, lets create a div for error-logs, but without any title, on this div, we will add in small red letter, we visualize any error that can usually be seen in the browser console log. so the user doesnt have to open the console tab in dev tools. when we hit the reset button, the error-logs messages will also be cleared.
